The API is defined in the `api/v1.yaml` file. If you want to update the API, you need to update the `api/v1.yaml` file,
then run `make gen-spec` to generate the API client and server code. 

The database schema is defined in `sql/migrations`, if the code is not committed, you only need to add one migration file and then modify this file in your following updates.
The database operations are defined in `sql/queries`, if you add new queries, you need to add them to the `sql/queries` directory.
After updateing the schema or queries, you need to run `make gen-querier` to generate the database operations code.
Then you can use those generated code in ModelInterface.

If you change constructors of services or controllers, you need to run `make gen-wire` to generate the dependency injection code.

If you want to mock an interface, modify `Makefile` to add a command to generate the mock code under `gen-mock` target.

The safest way is to run `make gen` to generate all code in the right order.

If your code depends on some complicated services, like the database, you can use interface to decouple your code from the concrete implementation. This also make it easier to write unit tests.
