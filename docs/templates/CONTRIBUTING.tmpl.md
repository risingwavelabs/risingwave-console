# Contributing to WaveKit

We're excited that you're interested in contributing to WaveKit! This guide will help you get started with making contributions to the project.

## Contributing to Documentation

WaveKit's documentation is partially generated from templates located in the [docs/templates](docs/templates) directory. To make documentation changes:

1. Find the relevant template file in the templates directory
2. Make your changes to the template
3. Run `make doc` to regenerate the documentation files

This ensures documentation stays consistent and up-to-date across the project.
